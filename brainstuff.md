##Our Brain
###Left
* Sequentially organised
* Logical
* Everything is black or white
* Everything is seen as decisons, choices
* Concentrates on the details

###Right
* Randomly organised
* Creative
* Colourful
* Everything is seen as pictures and visuals
* Concentrates on the big overall picture

##Our Mind
###Conscious
* Used 92% of time
* Logical, related to the left brain

###Sub-Conscious
* Used 8% of time
* Illogical, hence related to the right brain

###Note
* Only when we enforce wishes/goals into our subconscious brain we get major will power to achieve them
* While enforcing use only 100% positive statements
* Visualise the wishes and goals to enforce them. (as subconscious is connected to the right side)
* To enforce something, thinking about just before sleeping helps as we slip into our subconscious mind then.
